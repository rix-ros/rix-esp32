   * @brief This will invoke a single iteration of the subscriber loop.
   *
   * @details Here is a breakdown of the subscriber loop:
   * There are two parts to the subscriber loop, the first is to check if the
   * Mediator has notified the Susbcriber of any new publishers and connect to
   * them. The second is to check the existing connections for new messages.
   *
   * Part 1:
   * 1. Check to see if a new connection has been made to the server.
   * 2. Accept a new connection.
   * 3. Read a rix::msg::mediator::Operation message. This contains fields for
   *    the opcode of the message and the length of the following message.
   * 4. Read the number of bytes specified by the Operation message.
   * 5. Check that the opcode is SUB_NOTIFY. Other opcodes are invalid.
   * 6. Deserialize the data into a SubNotify message.
   * 7. For each publisher in the SubNotify message, create a client using the
   *    ClientFactory and connect to the publisher's server. Store this client
   *    in the clients_ set.
   *
   * Important note: before calling connect, make sure that you set the client
   * to non-blocking mode. This is important because we cannot wait for the
   * publisher to accept our connection in this loop. What if we want to
   * subscribe to a publisher that belongs to our node? Would we be able to
   * wait for that connection if the publisher's accept call is invoked during
   * its spin_once function? No, because the node cannot call the publisher's
   * spin_once if it is stuck waiting for the subscriber's spin_once to return.
   *
   * Part 2:
   * 1. Iterate through each client in the clients_ set.
   * 2. If the client is not ok(), erase it (this means that a hang up event
   *    has occured, meaning the publisher has closed the connection.)
   * 3. If the client is not connected or readable, skip it (this means that
   *    the publisher has not accepted our connection OR that it has not sent
   *    a message since the last iteration.)
   * 4. Read the prefixed size (4 bytes, use a rix::msg::standard::UInt32)
   * 5. Read the number of bytes specified by the size message.
   * 6. Invoke the callback on the byte array.
   *
